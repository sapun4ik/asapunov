          <h3 className="title">👨‍💻 Software Engineer &  Tech Leader: </h3>
          <p>
            As an accomplished software engineer and skilled technical leader, I have a proven track record of delivering successful projects across diverse industries. My expertise spans multiple technologies including Java/Kotlin/Spring, Golang ❤️, ReactJS/Typescript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, k8s, S3/Minio, and Redis.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my strengths is my ability to effectively lead and manage teams. I am skilled in conducting technical interviews, participating in sprint planning, goal setting, evaluation, and decomposition. I take pride in mentoring and guiding team members, facilitating one-on-one meetings, performance reviews, retrospectives, and fostering technical discussions and code reviews. My strong leadership skills and technical expertise make me a valuable asset to any organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my role as a technical lead, I have demonstrated my entrepreneurial spirit by developing a mobile game for learning English in the form of a quiz with my team a couple of years ago. This showcases my ability to work independently and create innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I am deeply interested in the field of blockchain and the metaverse, and I actively participate in the Landao Metaverse project (<a target='_blank' href='https://landao.studio/' rel="noreferrer">https://landao.studio/</a>), a groundbreaking Augmented Reality platform aimed at spreading happiness. My involvement in this project has allowed me to utilize a diverse tech stack including Go, ReactJS, Flutter, Elastic, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and WebSocket, showcasing my ability to develop and implement innovative solutions that meet the unique needs of the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            I aspire to continue growing as a technical leader, developer, and architect, leveraging my extensive experience in these areas. My strong passion for working with new and interesting technologies and projects continues to drive me. Additionally, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to open source projects as a part of my personal development journey. Technology is not just a profession for me, it is a way of life that I wholeheartedly embrace.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, as an experienced software engineer and proven technical leader, I bring a combination of technical expertise, leadership skills, entrepreneurial spirit, and innovative thinking to every project I undertake. I am confident in my ability to excel in any challenge and contribute positively to the success of any organization.
